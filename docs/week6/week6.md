# RESOURCES
I highly recommend engaging in a comprehensive learning approach. Start by watching at least one tutorial video from each subject, carefully assessing their content. Select the tutorial that resonates most with your learning preferences and embark on completing its hands-on projects. Additionally, I encourage you to utilize any spare time to enrich your knowledge further by delving into a book or informative doc. related to the subjects you are exploring. This well-rounded learning strategy will undoubtedly enhance your understanding and proficiency. 

Lastly, ensure a disciplined commitment to completing all assigned hands-on projects by the end of each week. By adhering to this diligent practice, you will reinforce your learning, gain practical experience, and foster a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
