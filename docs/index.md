# do-devops-projects

Hello,

I am glad you are here to learn and do everything Cloud computing and DevOps things. This site is an evolving project with an intention to guide the users while exploring free but useful resources on cloud computing and everything DevOps. The site already contains a wealth of information, including reference to tutorials, exercises, and hands-on projects. Learning any new concept with a proper guide to resources and its hands-on projects is the best way to learn.

Cloud Computing and DevOps roles are one of the most influential trend in software development. Thatâ€™s reflected in the fact DevOps engineer is currently one of the most in-demand IT roles. Right now, there are over 17,000 DevOps engineer roles advertised on Indeed.com in the USA alone with an average salary range of $96,600-$122,000. Both cloud computing and DevOps are relatively easy to learn, you must not miss out.

Some reasons why cloud computing and DevOps are easy to learn:

- The concepts are relatively simple: The basic concepts of cloud computing and DevOps are not very complex. This makes them accessible to people with a variety of backgrounds.
- There are many resources available: There are many online resources available to help people learn about cloud computing and DevOps. This includes tutorials, articles, and videos.
- There is a strong community: There is a strong community of cloud computing and DevOps professionals who are willing to help others learn. This community can provide support and guidance.

For convenience, I divided all the resource materials(the videos, books ref and links) into 12 weeks where each weeks focusing on 2 - 3 key subjects. I don't think you need to use all of the resources I have listed for each week, so don't be overwhelm. I recommend at least picking 1-2 tutorial videos that resonate with you and doing as many hands-on projects as possible, while you can always fall back to the other materials after this program.

If you see any issue with this documentation, please feel free to raise an issue on the github repo or drop a message for me on any of the handle.
