# do-devops-projects
Cloud computing and DevOps projects with guides from curated list of tutorials, bootcamp and hands-on projects.

This is a journey of utilizing guides from various YouTube tutorials, GitHub repos, bootcamp exercises and curated curriculums. Each week contains varying projects for real-world solution from setting up an environment that is using DevOps technologies and practices to building, deploying and monitoring apps on cloud infrastructure - AWS.

Also, this is your one-stop aggregator for learning DevOps tools and technologies. All sources and links used in this repository are properly referenced under the appropriate sections, providing you with the right resources for each tool and technology. The intention is to guide you from beginner to advanced levels in DevOps within your defined timeframe but for those willing to follow along with our Saturdays session we say 12 weeks. We assume, by committing an average of 3 hours daily, you can progress from zero to hero in the DevOps space.

If you are interested in learning and implementing these projects, it is highly recommended to ensure that you meet the necessary system requirements.
